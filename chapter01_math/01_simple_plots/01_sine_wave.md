Not much to talk about. It's a sine wave:
```
y = sin(t)
```

1. Run `sine_wave.ipynb`.
   - In a terminal run `jupyter notebook`
   - Find the file
   - Look around. Keep in mind that it can be run interactively

2. Run `sine_wave.py` with `python3 sine_wave.py`. Did it run? Check the code again, see if you can make the plot appear.

3. Let's dig deeper in `some_more_about_simple_plots.py`. We'll generate plots for `sin(t)`, `sin(3t)`, and `2 sin(3t + pi/2) + 1`.
