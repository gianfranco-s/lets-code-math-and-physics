## 4. Integrals
Now that we've become master derivators, let's tackle another calculus friend: the integral.
```
f(x) = 1 + x^2
```
We'll evaluate this function's integral in the interval [0,5], while comparing all three methods from before: analytical, numerical and symbolic.

Let's first perform the analytical integration.
```
F(x) = integral{ 1 + x^2 } = x + (1/3) x^3
```
When evaluating between the upper and lower limits we get
```
true_area = 140/3 =(aprox) 46.666667
```
