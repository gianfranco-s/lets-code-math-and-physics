# Code Physics and Math?

So you're studying a STEM field, and want to test your theory. What better place to start than a simulation?
That's what this repo is all about.

We'll essentially start learning how to use code to evaluate some mathematical expressions. First through some basic Math, and then try to apply the concepts to some Physics problems.

Python and Octave will be used. Pick your poison, and let's start.

### Chapter 1: some Math
1. [Simple plot: sine wave](chapter01_math/01_simple_plots/01_sine_wave.md)
2. Derivatives and velocity
3. Analytical vs numerical vs symbolic derivatives
4. Integrals
5. Taylor approximation
6. Contour lines
7. Common surfaces
8. Tangential plane to a paraboloid


### Chapter 2: some Physics
1. Projectile motion
2. Circular motion
3. Bouncing ball
4. Circular + projectile
5. Forces on a Ferris wheel
6. Electrical field
7. Trajectory of a particle submerged in a magnetic field
8. Let's animate!


### Chapter 3: some engineering
1. Solution to Ordinary Differential Equations
2. Mechanical oscilations
3. Mechanical oscilations with 2dof
4. RLC circuit
5. Heat equation


## About file extensions
Whenever you see a file
* `.ipynb`, think "jupyter notebook". You can open an interactive editor from the command prompt (bash, powershell, etc)
* `.py`, think "python script". You can run the script non-interactively. Useful when you know what you're doing. Execute from command prompt.
* `.m`, think Octave (or if you have the license, MATLAB).
